**Porftolio - Nimesh Maharjan**

Portfolio website created with React and Tailwindcss. Framer motion is used for the animations and a package called react-wavy-transitions by *FrontendJoe* for the page transitions with react-router-dom.

If you would like to use this template just clone the repo and install the dependencies, no vite plugins has been used. The package manager I have used is pnpm as it is slightly faster compared to yarn and npm.

It has been deployed to Vercel: [Live URL](https://portfolio-ten-black-27.vercel.app/)
